# Data sources

Rasters.jl uses a number of backends to load raster data. `Raster`, `RasterStack`
and `RasterSeries` will detect which backend to use for you, automatically.

## GRD

R GRD files can be loaded natively, using Julias `MMap` - which means they are very fast, but are not compressed. They are always 3 dimensional, and have `Y`, `X` and [`Band`](@ref) dimensions.

## NetCDF

NetCDF `.nc` files are loaded using
[NCDatasets.jl](https://github.com/Alexander-Barth/NCDatasets.jl). Layers from
files can be loaded as `Raster("filename.nc"; name=:layername)`. Without `name`
the first layer is used. `RasterStack("filename.nc")` will use all netcdf variables
in the file that are not dimensions as layers. 

NetCDF layers can have arbitrary dimensions. Known, common dimension names are
converted to `X`, `Y` `Z`, and `Ti`, otherwise `Dim{:layername}` is used. Layers
in the same file may also have different dimensions.

NetCDF files still have issues loading directly from disk for some operations.
Using `read(ncstack)` may help.

## GDAL

All files GDAL can access, such as `.tiff` and `.asc` files, can be loaded,
using [ArchGDAL.jl](https://github.com/yeesian/ArchGDAL.jl/issues). These are
generally best loaded as `Raster("filename.tif")`, but can be loaded as
`RasterStack("filename.tif"; layersfrom=Band)`, taking layers from the `Band`
dimension, which is also the default.

## SMAP

The [Soil Moisture Active-Passive](https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/) dataset provides
global layers of soil moisture, temperature and other related data, in a custom
HDF5 format. Layers are always 2 dimensional, with `Y` and `X` dimensions.

These can be loaded as multi-layered `RasterStack("filename.h5")`. Individual
layers can be loaded as `Raster("filename.h5"; name=:layername)`, without `name`
the first layer is used.

## Writing file formats to disk

Files can be written to disk in all formats other than SMAP HDF5 using
`write("filename.ext", A)`. See the docs for [`write`](@ref). They can (with
some caveats) be written to different formats than they were loaded in as,
providing file-type conversion for spatial data.

Some metadata may be lost in formats that store little metadata, or where
metadata conversion has not been completely implemented.

## RasterDataSources.jl integration

[RasterDataSources.jl](https://github.com/EcoJulia/RasterDataSources.jl)
standardises the download of common raster data sources, with a focus on
datasets used in ecology and the environmental sciences. RasterDataSources.jl is
tightly integrated into Rasters.jl, so that datsets and keywords can be used
directly to download and load data as a `Raster`, `RasterStack`, or `RasterSeries`.

````@example
using Rasters, CairoMakie, Dates
using RasterDataSources
A = Raster(WorldClim{Climate}, :tavg; month=June)
Makie.plot(A)
````

See the docs for [`Raster`](@ref), [`RasterStack`](@ref) and [`RasterSeries`](@ref),
and the docs for `RasterDataSources.getraster` for syntax to specify various
data sources.
