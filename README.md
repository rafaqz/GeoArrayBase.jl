GeoData.jl defines common types and methods for working with spatial data,
such as 2 or multidimensional raster arrays, multi-array stacks, and series of
stacks or arrays spread over multiple files. It provides a standardised
interface that allows many source data types to be used with identical syntax.

Data loaded with GeoData.jl has some special properties:

- Plots are always oriented the right way. Even if you reverse or permute a `GeoArray` it will still plot the right way!
- Regions and points selected with `Between` and `Contains` select the right points or whole intervals 
  no matter the order of the index or it's position in the cell.
- For `Projected` mode `GRDarray` and `GDALarray` You can index in any projection you want to by setting the 
  `mappedcrs` keyword on construction. You don't even need to know the underlying projection, the conversion is 
  handled automatically. This means lat/lon `EPSG(4326)` can be used across all sources seamlessly if you need that.
- Packages building on GeoData.jl can treat `AbstractGeoSeries`, `AbstractGeoStack`, and `AbstrackGeoArray`
  as black boxes:
  - The data could hold tiff or netcdf files, `Array`s in memory or `CuArray`s on the GPU - they
    will all behave in the same way.
  - `AbstractGeoStack` can be a Netcdf or HDF5 file, or a `NamedTuple` of `GDALarray` holding `.tif` files,
    or all `GeoArray` in memory, but be treated as if they are all the same thing.
  - Modelling packages do not have to deal with the specifics of spatial file types directly.
  

GeoData.jl extends
[DimensionalData.jl](https://github.com/rafaqz/DimensionalData.jl) so that
spatial data can be indexed using named dimensions like `Lat` and `Lon`, `Ti`
(time), which can also be used in most `Base` and `Statistics` methods like
`mean` and `reduce` where `dims` arguments are required. Much of the behaviour
is covered in the [DimensionalData
docs](https://rafaqz.github.io/DimensionalData.jl/stable/).

GeoData.jl provides general types for holding spatial data: `GeoArray`,
`GeoStack`, and `GeoSeries`, and types specific to various backends for loading
disk-based data. All can be loaded using the functions `geoarray`, `stack` and
`series`, that will guess the backend from the file type. R `.grd` files can be
loaded natively, GDAL when [ArchGDAL.jl](https://github.com/yeesian/ArchGDAL.jl)
(v0.5 or higher) is imported, and NetCDF can be loaded when
[NCDatasets.jl](https://github.com/Alexander-Barth/NCDatasets.jl) is imported.

When HDF5.jl is imported, files from the Soil Moisture Active Passive
([SMAP](https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/)) dataset can be loaded with `stack` or
`series`. This is both useful for users of SMAP, and a demonstration of the
potential to build standardised interfaces for custom spatial dataset formats
like those used in SMAP.

Files can be written to disk in all formats using `write`, and can (with some caveats)
be written to to different formats providing file-type conversion for spatial data.


# Warning: this is an MVP. 

It works quite well but spatial data is very complicated. Some things may break.
Currently saving a Netcdf to a GDAL tif, or the reverse, projections are not totally accurate.

Eventually they will be, but converting projections and index conventions between formats
is difficult. with many edge case problems. For now, assume the index is not exactly correct.
`Between`, `Contains` and `bounds` are close approximatios, but may contain errors.

## Examples

We'll load a file from disk, and do some manipulations and plotting.

Load GeoData, and NCDatasets, download file and load it to 
an array. This netcdf file only has one layer, if it has more we 
could use `NCDstack` instead.

```julia
julia> using GeoData, NCDatasets

julia> url = "https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/examples/tos_O1_2001-2002.nc";

julia> filename = download(url, "tos_O1_2001-2002.nc");

julia> A = geoarray(filename)
NCDarray (named tos) with dimensions:
 Longitude (type Lon): Float64[1.0, 3.0, …, 357.0, 359.0] (Converted: Ordered Regular Intervals)
 Latitude (type Lat): Float64[-79.5, -78.5, …, 88.5, 89.5] (Converted: Ordered Regular Intervals)
 Time (type Ti): DateTime360Day[DateTime360Day(2001-01-16T00:00:00), DateTime360Day(2001-02-16T00:00:00), …, DateTime360Day(2002-11-16T00:00:00), DateTime360Day(2002-12-16T00:00:00)] (Sampled: Ordered Irregular Points)
and data: 180×170×24 Array{Union{Missing, Float32},3}
[:, :, 1]
 missing  missing     missing  …  271.437  271.445  271.459
 missing  missing     missing     271.438  271.445  271.459
...
```

Now plot every third month in the first year, just using the regular index:

```julia
julia> using Plots

juila> A[Ti(1:3:12)] |> plot
```

![Global ocean surface temperatures](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaqz/GeoData.jl/media/four_pane_map.png)

Now plot Australia in the first month of 2001. Notice we are using lat/lon coordinates 
and date/time instead of regular indexes:

```julia
julia> A[Ti(Near(DateTime360Day(2001, 01, 17))), 
         Lat(Between(0.0, -50.0)), 
         Lon(Between(100.0, 160.0))] |> plot
```

![Australia regional ocean surface temperature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaqz/GeoData.jl/media/aus.png)

Now get the mean over the timespan, then save it to disk, and plot it :

```julia
julia> using Statistics
julia> mean_tos = mean(A; dims=Ti)
GeoArray (named tos) with dimensions:
 Longitude (type Lon): Float64[1.0, 3.0, …, 357.0, 359.0] (Converted: Ordered Regular Intervals)
 Latitude (type Lat): Float64[-79.5, -78.5, …, 88.5, 89.5] (Converted: Ordered Regular Intervals)
 Time (type Ti): DateTime360Day[2001-01-16T00:00:00] (Sampled: Ordered Irregular Points)
and data: 180×170×1 Array{Union{Missing, Float32},3}
[:, :, 1]
 missing  missing     missing     missing  …  271.434  271.443  271.454
 missing  missing     missing     missing     271.434  271.443  271.454
...

julia> write("mean.ncd", NCDarray, mean_tos)
    Writing netcdf...
        key: "longitude" of type: Float64
        key: "latitude" of type: Float64
        key: "time" of type: DateTime360Day
        key: "tos" of type: Union{Missing, Float32}
"mean.ncd"

julia> plot(mean_tos; color=:viridis) 
```

![Mean temperatures](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaqz/GeoData.jl/media/mean.png)

Plotting recipes in DimensionalData.jl are the fallback for GedData.jl when 
the object doesn't have both `Lat` and `Lon` dimensions. So (as a random example) we 
could plot a transect of ocean surface temperature at 20 degree latitude :

```julia
A[Lat(Near(20.0)), Ti(1)] |> plot
```

![Temperatures at lattitude 20-21](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaqz/GeoData.jl/media/lat_20.png)


GeoData.jl provides a range of other methods that are being added to over time.
One example is `aggregate`, that can aggregate `GeoArray` by axis-specific amounts:

```julia
julia> aggregate(mean, A, (Ti(12), Lat(20), Lon(20))

GeoArray (named tos) with dimensions:
 Longitude (type Lon): Float64[21.0, 61.0, …, 301.0, 341.0] (Converted: Ordered Regular Intervals)
 Latitude (type Lat): Float64[-69.5, -49.5, …, 50.5, 70.5] (Converted: Ordered Regular Intervals)
 Time (type Ti): DateTime360Day[2001-01-16T00:00:00, 2002-01-16T00:00:00] (Sampled: Ordered Irregular Points)
and data: 9×8×2 Array{Union{Missing, Float32},3}
[:, :, 1]
 missing  277.139        missing     missing     missing     missing  missing  missing
 missing  277.126        missing     missing     missing     missing  missing  missing
```

This will also work for entire `GeoStacks` and `GeoSeries` using the same syntax.



## Works in progress

- Integration with Vector/DataFrame spatial types and point/line/polygon data
  types. It should be possible to select polygons of data, and convert between
  linear datasets and array formats.
- Standardised handling and conversion of spatial metadata between data formats
- Handling complex projections: Affine transformation of dimensions to indices.
  AffineMaps will be stored as a wrapper dimension in `dims`.
- Load and write the NetCDF projection format.
