Your problem. You don't have to write anything here for a bug, the code and error are what is important.

```julia
All the julia code needed to make the error goes here including download or generation of all data used

This is the most important thing in the issue, we cant fix bugs without it.
```

```julia
The full complete error from start to finish goes here

This is the second most imortant thing in the issue, we can't be sure we fixed the same problem unless we can see this.
```

```julia
Paste the results of `versioninfo()` here.

Paste the results of `] status Rasters` here.
```
