########################
Pleas fill all code blocks below, then read and remove this message.

Its important that your example *just runs*, and we can copy and paste the code into Julia and it does that same thing for us that it does for you. 

That means either generating or downloading data inside the script, e.g. with `download`. 
########################

```julia
All the julia code needed to make the error goes here including download or generation of all data used

This is the most important thing in the issue, we cant fix bugs without it.
```

```julia
The full complete error from start to finish goes here

This is the second most important thing in the issue, we can't be sure we fixed the same problem unless we can see this.
```

```julia
Paste the results of `versioninfo()` here.

Paste the results of `] status Rasters` here.
```
